# Distance-Vector-Routing

This project developed as part of Georgia Techâ€™s CS6250 Computer Networks graduate course. The objective was to run distance vector routing protocols to find the shortest paths by solving the Bellman-Ford equation at each node. The resulting code was able to accurately detect negative cycles and effectively calculate routing paths. An example topology with a negative cycle is shown below.
